Overall Assessment: 2/5

Additional Comments: 

Overall I can see that you understand the changes the need to happen when the association was updated to a many to many. You added the join table and the intialize methods are correct. However, your relationship methods aren't there. You should have rewrote the `author.books` method and the `book.author` method to accurately reflect the new many to many relationship but it looks like you just deleted both methods. We still want an author to see all of their books and a book should be able to see all of their authors. Without those relationship methods, the associations are incomplete. 

Take a look back at your methods and make the necessary changes and then resubmit your work.
